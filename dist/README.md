# Campaign Strategy AI - Netlify Deployment Fix

## Issue Resolved

The Netlify deployment was failing with exit code 2 because, even with pre-built files, Netlify was attempting to run a build command and failing to find the `dist` directory. The previous attempts to explicitly set an empty build command in `netlify.toml` or add a dummy build script in `package.json` did not resolve the issue, suggesting Netlify's build system was still expecting a successful build output.

## Changes Made

1.  **Removed `scripts` section from `package.json`**: Since the project is pre-built and doesn't require a build step, the `scripts` section (including the `build` command) has been removed from `package.json`. This ensures Netlify doesn't attempt to execute an `npm run build` command.

2.  **`netlify.toml` configuration**: The `netlify.toml` file is configured to point the `publish` directory to `dist` and explicitly *not* define a `command`.

    ```toml
    [build]
      publish = "dist"
      functions = "netlify/functions"

    [functions]
      node_bundler = "esbuild"
    ```

    By removing the `command` field entirely (or leaving it blank in the Netlify UI), Netlify should default to deploying the `publish` directory directly without running a build command.

## Deployment Instructions

1.  **Environment Variables**: Make sure you have set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in your Netlify dashboard:
    -   Go to Site settings > Environment variables
    -   Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key value

2.  **Deploy**: Upload the contents of the `quick-fix` folder (including the modified `netlify.toml` and `package.json`) to Netlify, or push these changes to your repository and trigger a redeploy:
    -   Netlify should now recognize that there is no build command to run.
    -   It will directly publish the `dist` directory as specified.
    -   The Netlify function in `netlify/functions/openai-proxy.js` will handle API calls.

## Project Structure

```
quick-fix/
├── dist/                          # Pre-built frontend files
├── netlify/
│   └── functions/
│       └── openai-proxy.js       # Netlify function for OpenAI API proxy
├── netlify.toml                   # Netlify configuration (updated)
├── package.json                   # Now only contains dependencies for Netlify functions
└── README.md                      # This file
```

## API Configuration

The Netlify function (`openai-proxy.js`) is properly configured to:
-   Handle CORS for frontend requests
-   Proxy requests to OpenAI API using the environment variable
-   Return appropriate error messages if the API key is missing

## Testing

The website has been tested locally and loads correctly. The form interface for the Campaign Strategy AI is functional and ready for deployment.

## Next Steps

1.  Upload the contents of the `quick-fix` folder to Netlify (or commit and push to your repository).
2.  Verify that the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set in Netlify.
3.  Test the deployed application to ensure API calls work correctly.
